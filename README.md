# An Exploration of Convolutional Neural Networks for Image Classification and Examination of the Performance of CPU vs GPU Parallel Computing

## Reading order:

The main project is entirely contained within the file project2.ipynb. The reflection is also in the form of a .ipynb notebook file. This project is best viewed in Jupyter Notebook.

The runtime for the more computationally intensive cells of code is indicated in bold before each cell. The total runtime of the file project2.ipynb takes ~1300 seconds. The file is saved with all the cell outputs after a full run-through. 

### Dependencies

If any package is required, run !pip install package_name into a cell in the ipynb file.

This project requires a system with a GPU to output all of the results discussed successfully.

List of Python modules used:

- torch
- torchvision
- time
